# Bioinformatics Analysis Using Python: Reading Frames and Protein Translation

This project implements essential bioinformatics techniques for analyzing nucleotide sequences, identifying open reading frames, and translating them into protein sequences. It provides computational tools to handle sequence files, parse codon charts, and explore overlapping protein sequences.

## Features
- **Codon Chart Parsing**: Reads a codon-to-amino acid mapping file for nucleotide translation.
- **Sequence Parsing**: Processes FASTA-formatted sequence files.
- **Reverse Complement Calculation**: Generates the reverse complement of DNA sequences.
- **Reading Frames Identification**: Detects all six reading frames (three forward and three reverse).
- **Overlapping Protein Translation**: Identifies and translates overlapping proteins from nucleotide sequences.
- **Open Reading Frames Analysis**: Handles nested start codons and overlapping sequences for meaningful protein translation.

## Workflow
1. **Input Files**:
   - `codon_file.txt`: A text file mapping codons to amino acids.
   - `sequence_file.fasta`: A FASTA file containing nucleotide sequences.
2. **Processing**:
   - Parse codon and sequence files.
   - Compute all six reading frames.
   - Identify overlapping proteins starting from `ATG` and translate them.
3. **Output**:
   - Protein sequences for all detected reading frames.

## Example Usage
1. Prepare the input files:
   - `codon_file.txt` (example):
     ```
     ATG M
     TAA *
     TAG *
     ...
     ```
   - `sequence_file.fasta` (example):
     ```
     >Example Sequence
     ATGCGTACGTAGCGTAA
     ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python BioinformaticsProject.py codon_file.txt sequence_file.fasta
